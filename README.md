# Assembler

#Background 
I didn't know if I should have uploaded this project, as its just a university assingmant that I took totaly off the rails...
The original projects was cool by itself as it asked us to build a 12 bit assebler. I just had one issue with it. It had to many guide lines.
The question tells us: what data structures to use, how the assembler flow should work, what can we assume, etc'.
So I have decided to create my own type of assembler, with uniqe techniqes, data structures usage and most importantly the flow.
I won't lie, *this was the worst mistake of my life*... Who am I to redesing an assembler. This made it nearlly impossible. 
But as my mom told me when I was a child, "Finish what you started".


#Key things I tried to impliment 
- No memory leaks
- Concepts from the book "Clean Code" (I know main() itself doesn't look like it)
- Macro's for functions that may take different types of pointers.
- High cohesion (Yes its an OOP term, but you get me).
- Diversity of data structures.


#Issues
- Both the .pdf (question) and .docx (side notes I made) are in hebrew. Sorry none-hebrew-speaking fellas.
- The question is 25 pages long with very "sophisticated" hebrew terms. So even the hebrew speakers may face diffilcuties.
- The Main() function is 215 lines long. (But remember its C).
- The program is pretty efficient except the 3 Symbols tables which are extremly not (But I was egar to impliment HashTables).
